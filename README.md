Meta Mapping functionality for the **LD Archive**, to enable Jetpack Search to search in the site custom metadata.

##Â About

The site [ld-archive.org](https://ld-archive.org) uses [Jetpack Search](https://jetpack.com/upgrade/search/)
to deliver search results to users of the site. The deafault [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) search doesn't search any custom metadata.

After having tried a few options. This custom plugin seemed like the easiest solution.
It makes use of the template from the FAQs on Jetpack Search, which you can find at [the Jetpack Search Webpage.](https://jetpack.com/support/search/frequently-asked-questions/)

## Build and Running
In order for this to work on the site, it needs to be zipped and uploaded to the Wordpress Admin Plugins page. Manual updating is required for any changes.
